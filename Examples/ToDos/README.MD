#### Introduction

To Do's is a classic example of the simple single page application developed
in TypeScript using the Ajs Frontend Application framework.

The Visual Studio 2015 solution is consisted of three projects:

1) ToDos.boot project

    is the configuration project for the Ajs Framework. It contains only one
    TypeScript file - bootconfig.ts and tsconfig file for Debug and Release configuration.
    The project has a pre-build action which takes care of selecting the correct tsconfig
    configuration file based on the Visual Studio compilation configuration. This action
    modifies the tsconfig.json file to inherit the correct config file.

    The project is configured to compile TS to a single file - /bin/ToDos.Boot.js which is
    afterwards collected by the AjsWebApp and placed to /js folder where is accessible by
    the browser.

2) AjsWebApp project

    AjsWebApp project is used as a helper and startup project. It contains the gulp file
    which takes care of collecting resources from other two projects and helping to continuously
    monitor and collect changed files during the development. Basically, it is used to build the
    final application. Addtitionaly, it sets up the IIS Express to be possible to debug the
    application through IE11 directly in the Visual Studio. However, it takes quiet long time
    to build and start the application in IE11 so another recommended way is to use the IIS
    installed locally and use preferred browser for debugging. Moreover, some debugging features,
    such as Data Tool Tips (hovering mouse over the variable to get its current value) does not work
    correctly with virtual files in Visual Studio at this time.

    See [AjsWebApp](https://github.com/atomsoftwarestudios/AjsWebApp) at GitHub for details.

3) ToDos

    contains implementation of the To Do's application. There are following important files and
    folders:

    Folder / File                   | Description
    ------------------------------- | -----------
    /wwwroot                        | Contains static resources. AjsWebApp project collects files and folders from this place and places them to web root (/)
    /wwwroot/index.html             | Index page of the single page applications. Contains scripts to be loaded and other info i.e. metatags for mobile devices
    /wwwroot/templates              | Used to store templates and appropriate style sheets
    /wwwroot/templates/default.css  | Stylesheet used by the default template
    /wwwroot/templates/default.html | HTML template with VisualComponents used for the To Do's page
    /Components                     | Contains visual components implemented in the TypeScript language
    /Components/Tasks               | Code-behind (ViewModel or ViewComponent) class implementation for the Tasks form
    /Components/TaskItem.ts         | Code-behind (ViewModel or ViewComponent) class implementation for the single to do item
    /Models                         | Contains models to acccess and modify the data used by ViewComponents
    /Models/Tasks.ts                | Implementation of the data model for the To Do application
    
    ViewComponents contains the code to respond events generated by the UI and set the view state of the
    particular VisualComponent (defined by the template).

#### Style sheet (Visual component style)

default.css is a standart CSS 2/3.0 file containing the set of CSS classes to be used in the Visual Components
template.
