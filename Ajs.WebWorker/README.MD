The Ajs Web Worker is used internally by Ajs Framework to offload internal framework tasks out of the main JavaScript thread in order to
be possible to use maxium of the CPU performance and allow smooth operations above the main DOM document to provide maximum possible UI
to end users. Additionally, it should be used by applications to offload intensive model tasks to do so.

For more information about the Ajs Worker visit the [Ajs Framework Documentation](https://ajsfw.azurewebsites.net) application.
