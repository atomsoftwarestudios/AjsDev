            Please note the AjsDoc is the example application for the Ajs framework so it is available in offline mode too. It currently consumes about 6 megabytes of the indexed DB storage
            for all (unoptimized) resources it is using so if you don't want to have these data stored in your browser you have to clean the application cache using developer tools.

    <p>
        AJS (pronounce /aɪs/) is JavaScript MVVM Single Page Application framework written in TypeScript focused to the rapid web browser application development, team role separation, offline
        web applications and great user experience. It is developed with TypeScript (currently 2.2.1) with transpillation target ECMA5 (2015 and 2017 versions are focused and tested as well).
        It is developed in order to support standard web browsers starting with IE10.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ajs is provided with set of development tools focusing the Visual Studio (not Code, full one), currently in version 2015, support for VS 2017 is planned soon. This set of tools includes
        project and item templates, WebApp packer simplifying and speeding up the development process, documentation generator and documentation viewer (the same one you are looking to now).
        All tools are designed to add missing features for VS or make the development faster and easier. Also, setting up the development environment is easy and fast with this set of tools.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Ajs Framework code is written in the C# way so classes and interfaces are split to separate files and the design of the code overall is similar to the C#. Also, the MVVM concept has
        its inspiration in "Windows Forms" or the Borland "Delphi" concept (its probably more similiar to WPF as it is using separate language for template definition) except the data binding which
        is not supported now. The view state is managed in the React way but it is extended about templating in separate HTML files instead of JSXs. Ofcourse, everything is adopted to the Web environment
        so all the Web and Browser functionalities known to web users will stay the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ajs currently does not support any "dependency" loader such as require.js so the dependency and initialization of 3rd party libraries must be done manually according the documentation. Of course,
        other methods, like webpack, can be used to for the JavaScript single library package preparation.
    </p>

        Issues, changelog and project management of the Ajs Framework project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/atomsoftwarestudios/Ajs">GitHub</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Until the Ajs Framework version 1.0.0 will be released the source code for complete set of tools including examples is managed in <a href="https://github.com/atomsoftwarestudios/AjsDev">GitHub AjsDev</a>
        repository.
